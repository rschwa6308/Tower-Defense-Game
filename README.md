# Tower-Defense-Game
A fun tower defense game made in Python using pygame.

Concept:
- a vanilla tower defense game with a twist: enemies can shoot back
- fantasy medieval setting (orcs, archers, mages, etc.)

Note on balance:
- upgrade levels increase skill amount by O(1.1^n)
- upgrade levels increase in cost by O(1.3^n)
