Need:
if projectile is fired and enemy aimed at dies projectile should die
make better graphics
tower strength balancing 
enemy kill order

These are things that could be done--
	fix the mouse always changing on screen update
	making switching modes possible <-- Big step
	make towers use ai to figure out when to attack
	make towers rotate towards enemy they are firing at
	make the enemy's difficulty scale more exponentially rather than in a logistic growth curve
	make background either larger or a function of pixel position.
	don't need to do this too soon == make Walls a separate abstract class
		
"Done":
	make a godmode - done only increases money rediculously, lowers health and allows the below error
	make so you can't repeat hit the wave button to get the same wave multiple times - done {godmode disables}
	make attacks on tower actually change the hearts num and end game settings - done on basic level needs end screen
	make enemies split into weaker enemies on death - done for tanks
	max tower upgrades- done for now
	making all of the towers scale with resolution size - done
	making the base scale with resolution size - done
