These are things that could be done--
	making all of the towers scale with resolution size
	making the base scale with resolution size
	making switching modes possible <-- Big step
	make better graphics
	make the enemy's difficulty scale more exponentially rather than in a logistic growth curve
	make background either larger or a function of pixel position.
	make Walls a separate abstract class
