Need:
make attacks on tower actually change the hearts num and end game settings
make so when repeat hit the wave button it updates the wave # and goes to next wave

These are things that could be done--
	making switching modes possible <-- Big step
	make towers use ai to figure out when to attack
	make better graphics
	make towers rotate towards enemy they are firing at
	make the enemy's difficulty scale more exponentially rather than in a logistic growth curve
	make background either larger or a function of pixel position.
	don't need to do this too soon == make Walls a separate abstract class
		
		
		make enemies split into weaker enemies on death - done for tanks
		max tower upgrades- done for now
		making all of the towers scale with resolution size - done
		making the base scale with resolution size - done
